- Authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access.
- Integration with affiliate marketing APIs for data retrieval.
- Background jobs for periodic data updates.

### Database: MongoDB
- Stores user data, campaign information, and analytics.
- Quick retrieval of relevant data for dashboard rendering.
- Scalable for handling a growing volume of marketing data.

### Authentication System: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Secure user authentication and token-based authorization.
- Protects sensitive data and ensures secure user sessions.

### Real-time Communication: WebSocket (Socket.io)
- Real-time updates for metrics and notifications.
- Enhances user experience with live data.

### Backend (Node.js with Express.js)
- Development of RESTful API endpoints for frontend-backend communication.
- Middleware for authentication and authorization.
- Controllers to handle data retrieval from affiliate marketing APIs.
- Background jobs using tools like Agenda or Bull for periodic data updates.

### Database (MongoDB)

### Authentication (JWT)
- Generation of JWTs upon user login and refresh as needed.
- Secure storage and validation of JWTs for user sessions.
- Token expiration to enhance security.

### Real-time Communication (WebSocket)
- Establishment of WebSocket connections for real-time updates.
- Emitting events for changes in metrics, ensuring timely notifications.
- Implementation of error handling and reconnection strategies.

## Additional Considerations

- Implementation of logging for tracking user actions and debugging.
- Securing the application with HTTPS to protect data during transit.
- Regular updates of dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- Thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
